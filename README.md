# cleaning-Reddit-WSB-comments-Kaggle-dataset
In this code I am cleaning the Wall street bets comment dataset found on Kaggle here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattpodolak/reddit-wallstreetbets-comments
The aim of this cleaning is to align mis-aligned columns and to prepare the data for machine learning by doing things like, 
 deleting NaN and bad data,
 removing special characters,
 converting to lower case,
 removing extra whitespace,
 removing stop words,
 lemmatizing words,
 tokenizing the text,
 dropping data that is not relevant for topic modling, ie comments like "yes", "no"
